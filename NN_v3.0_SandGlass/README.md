* Autoencoder
* Inception
* Attention
## Basic idea:

front inception: receive the information, translation into our brain.

center fully connected layer: Our brain. Here it thinking

Reply inception: Verbalize what we are thinking.
verbalize the 

## Pros:
- Compare to traditional seq2seq model, this mechanism is less likely to lose information.
- Easy to perform parallel computing, expected to be trained faster.
- Can be trained without decoder input. 
- Relatively robust, since the prediction is dependent on the whole corpus rather than highly depends on the previous output.

## Cons:
1. Complicated.


## Future work:

Memory, personality.
