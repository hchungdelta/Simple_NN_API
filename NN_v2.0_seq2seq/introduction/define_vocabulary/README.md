# Define vocabulary

Unlike English, commonly in the Japanese language(and also Chinese), the sentence is constructed by word in consecutive order, without space to separate the word.
For example:

English: I went to the office, but no one was there

日本語: 私はオフィスへ行ったけど、誰もいなかった

If we write this sentence In English vein, it would look like:

日本語: 私  は  オフィス  へ  行った  けど、誰  も  いなかった
